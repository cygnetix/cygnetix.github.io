          SELinux isn’t everyone’s favourite operating system feature but, love it or hate it, it’s now been an integral part of the RedHat Enterprise Linux OS for some time and isn’t going anywhere any time soon.
Usually the bad experiences admins have with SELinux are much the same; they’ve moved some files, or possibly trying to serve up files from a non-default directory, and things just mysteriously don’t work. Hours of consulting documentation and trawling through Google finally points them in the direction of the /var/log/audit/audit.
